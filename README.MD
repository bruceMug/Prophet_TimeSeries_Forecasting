#  TimeProphet: The Power of Prophet for Time Series Forecasting

This repository contains code examples and data files for performing time series forecasting using the Prophet library. Prophet is a powerful open-source library developed by Facebook's Core Data Science team for analyzing and forecasting time series data. It provides a user-friendly interface and incorporates various built-in features to handle common challenges in time series analysis.

## Installation
To use the Prophet library for time series forecasting, you need to have Python (3.x) and the following dependencies installed:
    - prophet
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - numpy

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```pip install prophet pandas matplotlib numpy```

For more detailed instructions on installing Prophet, please refer to the [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html).
